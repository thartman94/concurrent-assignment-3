## Concurrent Programing - Assignment 2

Rowan University

Professor: Patrick McKee

Semester: Spring 2022

## Instructions:

All UI is through the terminal

Instructions are displayed during each interation:

1. Single thread execution
2. Multi thread execution
3. Exit

Then enter the number you want to evaluate, execution time as well as some
sanity checks will print after the input is processed.

## Assignment Details

For this assignment, we will expand upon Part 1. Having a quality part 1 means
that most of your program will be finished already!

For this assignment, we want to add a menu option to the user that the user can
navigate via the command line. The user will be able to switch between the
"styles" of solution for this problem. The styles of solution are as follows:

1. Single Threaded (you can use your part 1 solution for this)

2. Unbounded Thread (generate a new thread for each unit of work)

Each option should do the same thing as part 1, but under a new method. After a
calculation, I should be able to switch to another version until I need to quit.

Time each version - we want to see what the differences are between your
implementations!

Zip up your classes with a README telling me how to get it launched.
